A PCA plot converts the correlations(or lack there of) among all of the features into a 2-D graph.

PCA is a method for compressing a lot of data into something that captues the essence of the original data.

PCA is just one way to make sense of this type of data. There are lots of other methods that are variations on this theme of "dimension reduction"

Few such alternatives

1] Heatmaps
2] t-SNE plots
3] Multi-Dimensional Scaling

Example for PCA:

PCA finds the best fitting line by maximizing the sum of the squared distances from the projected points to the origin.

 According to pythogorean theorem a^2 = b^2 + c^2



Tips for PCA:

1] Make sure the variables are on the same scale if not scale them.
