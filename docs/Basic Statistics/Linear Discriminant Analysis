Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) is similar to PCA, but it focuses on maximzing the seperatiability among known categories.


Example 

reduce a 2-D graph to 1-D 

LDA uses the information between 2 variables and a create a new axis which maxizes the distance between the two.

LDA:

1] Maximize the distance between means (mean1 - mean2)

2] Minimize the variation(which LDA calls scatter and is represented by s^2) within each category

Formula:

(mean1 - mean2)^2 / scatter1^2 + scatter2^2

similarities between PCA and LDA:

1] Both rank the new axes in order of importance

2] Both methods let you dig in and see which genes are driving the new axes
